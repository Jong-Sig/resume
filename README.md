## How to Compile the **LaTeX** file?

If you’d like to build the resume yourself:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Jong-Sig/resume.git

# Compile with latexmk
latexmk -pdf resume.tex
```

> **Note:** Make sure you have `latexmk` installed. On most systems, it comes with TeX Live or MikTeX.  
>  
> Alternatively, you can compile using:  
> - `pdflatex resume.tex`  
> - `xelatex resume.tex`  
> - `lualatex resume.tex`  
>  
> `latexmk` is recommended, but the others work as well.
